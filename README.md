SMARTi
SMARTi is a custom integration for Home Assistant designed and taylored to the SMARTi HUB (found here https://www.smarti.dev/smarti-store/p/smarti-hub-63mmp-lfckw-7l3tx).
Its purpose is to automate the download and update of various configuration files, including Node-RED flows, themes, dashboards, and more, from this GitHub repository. This integration ensures that the Home Assistant environment that is pre-installed and pre-configured for the SMARTi HUB, stays up-to-date with the latest configurations for a smooth user experience.
